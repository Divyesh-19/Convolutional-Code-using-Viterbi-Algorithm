# Convolutional-Code-using-Viterbi-Algorithm
In this project I made convolutional code for encoding and decoding message using viterbi decoding algorithm. In the matlab mlx file whole code is written. I wrote general function for encoding and decoding message. I took here three cases,
1. R = 1/2, Kc = 3,
2. R = 1/3, Kc = 4,
3. R = 1/3, Kc = 6.

I also made presentation for convolution coding scheme and based on why viterbi algorithm introduce.
In Viterbi algorithm and analysis pdf i wrote analysis and behaviour of graphs.
